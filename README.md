# rock-paper-scissors
A simple RPS exercise for TheOdinProject's cirriculum. 
It's a WIP project and extended functionality is expected to be added over time.

Here's a list of changes so far:

V1.1
- Changed rps.js to main.js
- Added HTML elements such as <select>, <h1> and <p> for making a choice and displaying the game results accordingly.
- Added querySelectors for the elements mentioned above, added new functions and reworked the overall structure of the javascript file. Helper functions added at the end of file.

  
  
V1.0
- First take at the project, bare bones game logic added with console output only.
